# Fitts
This program demonstrates Fitts's law: T = a + b * log2 (2d/w).

Fitts's law is a predictive model of human movement primarily used in humanâ€“computer interaction and ergonomics.
This scientific law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of
the ratio between the distance to the target and the size of the target.
